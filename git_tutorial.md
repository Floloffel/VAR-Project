# Git Tutorial 
# Hey. This is from memory, but should outline the most important steps to use git in VSCode.

Git Set Up:
* Log into git in VSCode
* make sure source control tab exists on left side
* open new VSCode window or start with empty
* Source Control: Clone Repository
    * paste URL from repositor website
    * select destination folder
    * you have now a synchronized repository

How to use git:
* once downloaded repositories keep connected with git
    * if you are not shure, if your folder is still connected with git, clone the repository again

* you interact with git via source control
    * (1) refresh and pull to get new changes
    * (2) code your code
        * every change will appear after saving under source control: changes
    * (3) commit changes (aka i want to publish my changes)
        * stage the files you want to commit via "+"
        * write a message (typically a short sentence to describe your changes)
        * commit
    * (4) push your commits
        * upload your commits to the repository

* best practice:
    * better more commits than less. You can splice bigger changes into multiple commits for better traceability
    * keep your local repository up to date via pulling / synchronizing
